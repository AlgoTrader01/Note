When working with `.md` (Markdown) files, mathematical notations need to be properly formatted to render correctly. Here are a few key tips for including mathematical notations in Markdown:

1. **Inline Math**: To include inline mathematical notation, use single dollar signs (`$`). For example:
   ```md
   This is inline math: $E = mc^2$.
   ```
   This will render as: *This is inline math: \(E = mc^2\).*

2. **Block Math**: For block-level mathematical notation, use double dollar signs (`$$`). For example:
   ```md
   $$ 
   \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a) 
   $$
   ```
   This will render as a centered block of math.

3. **Escaping Special Characters**: If your mathematical expressions contain special characters like `#`, `*`, or `_`, make sure to escape them using a backslash (`\`).

4. **MathJax Support**: Ensure that the Markdown viewer or platform you are using supports MathJax or a similar library for rendering LaTeX math. Not all Markdown parsers support mathematical notation out of the box.

5. **Using LaTeX**: Write your mathematical expressions in LaTeX. For example, the quadratic formula:
   ```md
   The quadratic formula is:
   $$
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   $$
   ```

If you’re using a Markdown editor or viewer that doesn’t support LaTeX, the mathematical notation may not render correctly. In such cases, consider converting your Markdown to HTML and embedding LaTeX using MathJax.
